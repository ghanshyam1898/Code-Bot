This program acts like an interpreter. It can execute the code present in a file.


I felt need for a programming language that could just interprete the code present in a file. Of course I did not know any of the existing interpreted languages then. So, I created this. But then I learnt about python and it was the thing I wished for. So, I discontinued this one.
